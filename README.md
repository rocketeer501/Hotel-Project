# Hotel-Project
This project serves as an introduction to SQL querying and data visualization through Power BI
Tools used for this are Microsoft SQL Server 2022, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2019, and Microsoft Power BI Desktop

The hotel_revenue_historical_full-2.xlsx is the dataset used for querying data
Hotel Project.sql is the SSMS file used for querying the imported .xlsx file data
Hotel Project.pbix is the Power BI data visualization file

This project serves to answer the following questions:
Is hotel revenue growing by year? There are two hotel types so it would be beneficial to break down revenue by type
Should parking lot size be increased? We want to know if there is an uptrend in guests with personal vehicles
What other trends can be gathered from the data? Focus on average daily rate and guests for seasonality
